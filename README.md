# WordPress Theme: Simple by PETJ

A very simple theme. Trying theme.json from scratch.

* Note the absence of index.php
* theme.json is the most important file here

Based on [this](https://fullsiteediting.com/lessons/creating-theme-json/) tutorial by *Carolina Nymark*.

On Carolina Nymark's website you can read about the finer details of theme.json and there is a nice **theme generator**.

* [Nymark's Theme Generator](https://fullsiteediting.com/block-theme-generator/)
* She also recommends the plugin ["Create Block Theme"](https://wordpress.org/plugins/create-block-theme/).

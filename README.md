# WordPress Themse: Simple by PETJ

A very simple theme. Trying theme.json from scratch.

## Development Process

* Create the theme as simple as possible.
* Install the theme in Wp.
* Add the pages you need in the editor (Gutenberg)
* When you're ready for it export the Theme

Note that the ./parts and ./templates will be populated with the template and template parts that you create. The theme.json will also change - for instance changes to specific blocks will become part of the file.

NB: of course the theme.json is made by Gutenberg after these iterations.
